--Version 3.4.1--
~~ Noticed version file is getting to long and is messing with client dimensions
~~ Noticed client breaks if there is no internet and no cache
~ Fixed client not running from media player error
~ Fixed calling Info Tab the dungtab

--Version 3.4--
~ Got rid of all unused methods, variables, and classes to make the client even smaller
~ Got a song to play as the client starts up
~ Songs can be played in the background just haven’t set it up yet, if you have any suggestions
on what to do tell me on the forum
~ Got the full screen thing to partially work again

[NOTE] How to get the full screen to work on tabbed with a menu bar of just menu bar mode 
you have to start up the client log into the server, put the client into full screen, then 
click on the full screen button in the menu bar. This will get you into full screen, but
you can't get out of it unless you restart the client.

--Version 3.3--
~ Half fixed the full screen problem then broke it again
~ Made the client smaller by shortening and getting rid of unused code

--Version 3.2--
~ Tool bar has been cleaned up and doesn’t have my debugging stuff in it
~ If you have a suggestion to add the tool bar tell me on the forums

--Version 3.1--
~ Added feature to switch between all modes of client
~ The new modes are still a WIP
~ Still working on music, I need suggestions on what music to include

[NOTE] To change between the different Client modes change the second word after Gui
to either Tabbed, ToolBar, Both, or None for the original. Also right now Full screen
only works in the original version. The last way to change it will not work on this 
version.
